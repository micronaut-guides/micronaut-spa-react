In the `initial` directory you should see a directory named `server`, containing a simple Micronaut application written in Java and using a Gradle build. The application includes a single controller, shown below:

.server/src/main/java/example/micronaut/HelloController.java
[source,java]
----
include::{sourceDir}/server/src/main/java/example/micronaut/HelloController.java[indent=0]
----

You can run the Micronaut application with the Gradle wrapper:

[source,bash]
----
~ cd server
~ ./gradlew run
----

Exercise the controller with a simple GET request:

[source,bash]
----
~ curl http://localhost:8080/Bob
  Hello, Bob!
----

Additionally, there is a directory named `client` which contains a React single-page-app. The project was generated using `create-react-app`, and has no modifications. If you have `yarn` installed and a Node.js installation of `10.x` or above, you can run the app as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
~ cd client
~ yarn install
~ yarn start
----
